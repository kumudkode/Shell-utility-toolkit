# Shell-utility-toolkit

Project name: shell-utils
Goal: Build a collection of simple, useful shell commands that automate common developer/system tasks.
As of now 18/oct/2025 
We are including these features:
1. sysinfo.sh → prints system info (CPU, memory, uptime, disk usage)

2. backup.sh → backs up a folder into a .tar.gz file

3. todo.sh → a simple command-line to-do list

4. netcheck.sh → checks internet connection and ping speed

5. cleanup.sh → cleans temporary files and caches
